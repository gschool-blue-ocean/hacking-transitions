### Deployed Application Access in Production & Login 
- Access the [Hacking Transitions Application](https://hacking-transitions-webservice.onrender.com/) hosted on [Render](https://render.com/). 
- To access student portal: student@student.com / "password" 
- To access admin portal: admin@admin.com / "password" 

  
# Objective & Requirements

## What is the _Hacking Transitions_ Application?

**Hacking Transitions** is a `client commissioned project` undertaken by a `small team of 6 software developers using the Agile Methodology` in `three 1-week sprints`, with the `goal of producing an MVP (minimal-viable-product) for the client`.

The client requests an application to be developed to assist the _[Galvanize: "Operation Level Up" Military Career Skills Program](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/operation-level-up-career-skills-program-info-session-tickets-150113466419)_ in helping its students and transition-team-staff with facilitating the logistics behind the student's military-to-civilian transition & course-onboarding.

Application is requested to include:

- **login/authentication portal:** enables login and authentication for students & admissions staff with a registration feature for new students via registration code; features user password recovery via email
- **student portal:** allows the student to view/edit/update their transition information & allows the student to directly message admissions staff; allows the student to update their account password
- **admin portal:** allows the admissions staff to access/track/manage student-inputed information from the student portal and assign/re-assign students to specified cohorts; allows admissions staff to directly message students or entire cohorts; allows admissions staff to maintain a database of archived cohorts/students information; allows admins to create new cohorts with a designated unique registration code; allows admissions staff to create/delete admin accounts; allows admins to update their account password

# What the app does and why...

The application is designed to `assist the transition team` at Galvanize in monitoring each student's required tasks, personal goals, and mandatory timelines set forth by their Military Branch of Service regarding their military-to-civilian transition.

- **Galvanize is responsible** - per an agreement with the U.S. military - _to facilitate and ensure that all students are developing a new technical skill-set full time within their curriculum and completing their military transition obligations._

- This `application` is designed to keep track of each student attending the Galvanize Software Engineering Program and their transition obligations.

- The `student` is able to login and view and update their information, create/delete personal tasks, and chat with a transition specialist. Additional helpful resources are avaliable for students at the login page.

- Galvanize staff transition specialists are able to login as an `admin` and are able to add/update/delete/archive cohorts, view and manage student data, and chat with cohorts as a group or students individually.

# Tech Implementation: _How the application works..._

This application uses **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)** as its dedicated `Front-end framework` on top of **[React](https://reactjs.org/)**, while **[Redux](https://redux.js.org/)** is used for dynamic state management. The app uses the **[Next.js API](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)** _that is built into the Front-end framework_ (see 'pages/api') to query a **[PostgreSQL Database](https://www.postgresql.org/)** that stores all relevant application data. **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)** is used to containerize the entire application to streamline development and deployment.

**[Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)** is used for login authentication and account creation during registration.

**[Socket.io](https://socket.io/)** is used to conduct chat operations between students and admins, ensuring near instantaneous sending & receiving of chat data via Websockets.

The **[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) / [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)** styling & component library is used for some modals, alerts, etc., and in tandem with traditional **[CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)** styling.

(**Note:** application directory format is in standard with the Next.js framework convention.)

# Installation & Setup

- Fork / clone down the main branch of this repo
- open your forked/cloned repo within your IDE and install dependencies:

```bash
*** from 'HACKING-TRANSITIONS' directory [root directory] ***

  npm install
```

#### **NOTE:** DOCKER DESKTOP IS REQUIRED TO RUN THIS APPLICATION

- If you do not have Docker Desktop installed and configured on your PC/Mac, go ahead and install Docker Desktop and configure Docker to be imaged with PostgreSQL.
- View the following documentation for instruction on install/setup: [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/)
- Once you have Docker Desktop up and running, execute the following commands from your IDE terminal:

```bash
*** from 'HACKING-TRANSITIONS' directory [root directory] ***

  docker compose up --build

```

- Allow docker compose to complete initialization

## Opening **Hacking Transitions** from Docker Desktop

- Once complete, you should have a containerized Docker application visible on Docker Desktop called **hacking-transitions**.
